# Eat-Da-Burger App!

## Description
Eat-Da-Burger! is a fun app that allows you to enter any burger you want and keep track of which ones you have devoured and which ones you are yet to eat.Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.The app then stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.


#### Objective
To create a burger app using `MySQL`, `Node`, `Express`, `Handlebars` and a homemade `ORM` (yum!). The project follows the MVC design pattern; uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
